luxembourg.14.d:0 "Despite the stormclouds gathering on the horizon, the politics of Luxembourg move ever onwards. The 1937 Election saw large turnouts for the Ritespartei and the social democrats. However, the conservative party's proposed Maulkuerfgesetz, designed to quench the growing popularity and voice of the KPL, has not proved as popular with the people. After an incredibly close referendum rejecting the law, Prime Minister Joseph Bech has had no choice but offer his resignation, fellow Ritespartei founder Pierre Dupong will now lead the country."
