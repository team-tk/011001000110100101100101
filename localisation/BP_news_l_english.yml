BP_news.3.d:0 "In a statement that surprised few today, the Fuhrer of the German Reich, Adolf Hitler, declared total victory over the armed forces of the Soviet Union. "Today we celebrate the fruits of our efforts!", he spoke today from the Reichstag, “The greatest threat that has ever existed to the German peoples, the people of Europe, and the civilized nations of the world is no more.” In his victory speech, the Fuehrer announced that former Soviet Union will be split between the Reich and the Japanese Empire: The Japanese would gain control over Kamchatka, Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and the greater territory of Eastern Siberia, while the Reich would gain control over Western Siberia. It is planned to create a Siberian "Neutral Zone" between the two States as a sign of good will, as well as to minimize possible military incidents between the two countries."

The Atlantic fleet has left its home port of Norfolk. “The fate of the free world,” - said President Roosevelt in his declaration to Congress this morning, “...cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of those who wish to extinguish its light. Our will remains unconquerable, remains firm, remains uncowed, remains eternal, and most of all, our will, and the will of all peoples who have this holy duty, remains free!”"

BP_news.13.t:0 "Coup d'état in Iraq!"
BP_news.13.d:0 "Early this morning, as a result of Anti-British sentiment in Iraq, a coup d'état took place in the country. The regime of Regent Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali al-Ghailani was declared Prime Minister. The coup was led by four Iraqi generals, who were in the nationalist group 'Golden Square'. Rumor has it that this group was funded by the German government. According to the rebels, in 1930 Iraq gained only formal independence because of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty imposed by great Britain. The new government announced the cancellation of all contracts with Britain and requires the withdrawal Of British bases from the territory of Iraq. There is no doubt that the British government will respond immediately to the actions of the new Iraqi government."
