 britain.9.t:0 "Chamberlain Resigns"
 britain.9.d:0 "With the war developing to the detriment of us and our allies, the Prime Minister has come under fire for both his peacetime and wartime decisions at critical junctions. At a moment when Britain needs to stand united more than ever, it finds itself divided as portions of the parliament holds Chamberlain in contempt.\n\nLacking vital support from Labour, the Prime Minister has made the decision to resign, favoring Lord Halifax as his replacement. However, Halifax has been skeptical and Chamberlain has advised the King to call on Winston Churchill. Halifax has popular support, but Churchill's prewar remarks now seem prescient, and a bulldog like him may be what we need for the coming war."
 britain.9.a:0 "Churchill will see us through."
 britain.9.b:0 "Halifax is the more sensible option
 
 britain.10.t:0 "Chamberlain Passes Away"
 britain.10.d:0 "Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain has fallen ill recently, despite previously generally having been healthy for his age. After being diagnosed with bowel cancer, increased pain and lost sleep has led him to resign from his post. Chamberlain still enjoys strong popular support and steps down only as a last resort, realizing he will not live to return to work.\n\nThe question remains who will take up the torch after this great statesman and lead Britain through the dark times that may still lie ahead of us."
 britain.10.a:0 "Churchill will see us through."
 britain.10.b:0 "Halifax is the more sensible option."

 britain.24.t:0 "Wallis Simpson"
 britain.24.d:0 "The new King-Emperor is a boyish and troublesome sort, prone to rudeness, defiance of tradition and worst of all, womanising. His latest affair is with a twice-divorced American socialite, Wallis Simpson - whom he declares his intent to marry. This presents a potential constitutional crisis, as the Church of England, which the British monarch presides over, forbids remarriage after divorce, not to even mention Simpson's low birth. Neither the British people nor those of our Dominions abroad will accept this American as queen - while we have managed to keep the media silent at home, the press runs wild abroad, and it will not be long before the British public catch wind of this scandal."
 britain.24.a:0 "This will have to get sorted out before the coronation"
 
 britain.25.t:0 "Abdication Crisis"
 britain.25.d:0 "As the coronation draws nearer, concern regarding the new King-Emperor's engagement to Wallis Simpson grows. The Dominion Prime Ministers have unanimously rejected her as a match for the British Sovereign, and the Baldwin government is threatening to collectively resign. The monarch now faces a simple choice - love, or duty?"
 britain.25.a:0 "What good is being a King if you can't marry the one you love?" 
 britain.25.b:0 "She will have to go for the good of the Empire"
 
 britain.26.t:0 "Coronation of Edward VIII"
 britain.26.d:0 "With the issue of Wallis Simpson long since cleared away, the coronation of the new British Sovereign has gone ahead smoothly. The monarch has been anointed, crowned, enthroned, and now reigns as Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The celebrations have been Empire-wide, with Indian and African Royalty attending the ceremonies in London along with Dominion leaders. From the mountains of the Yukon to the pleasant shores of Auckland, parades and festivities have been held. Coins bearing his unusually left-facing portrait have gone out across the Empire, along with stamps and other memorabilia. This has been the first coronation to take advantage of new technology, being filmed and broadcast on radio to the Empire's subjects, and the world."
 britain.26.a:0 "God save the King!" 
 
 britain.27.t:0 "Coronation of George VI"
 britain.27.d:0 "With the short and troubled reign of Edward VIII now behind the Empire, the rule of the previously little-known George VI has been ushered in with bombastic fashion. The monarch has been anointed, crowned, enthroned, and now reigns as George VI, King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The celebrations have been Empire-wide, with Indian and African Royalty attending the ceremonies in London along with Dominion leaders. From the wastes of the Yukon to the pleasant shores of Auckland, parades and festivities have been held. Coins and stamps bearing the monarch's image have gone out across the Empire, along with other memorabilia. This has been the first coronation to take advantage of new technology, being filmed and broadcast on radio to the Empire's subjects, and the world."
 britain.27.a:0 "God save the King!" 
 
 britain.28.t:0 "Newfoundland Referendum"
 britain.28.d:0 "In an early step towards a new policy of colonial self-determination, the citizens of Newfoundland have gone to the polls to decide the future of their country, and have voted by only a slim majority to join Canada."
 britain.28.a:0 "O, Canada!"  
 
 britain.29.t:0 "The Battle of Cable Street"
 britain.29.d:0 "Oswald Mosley's growing blackshirt street movement, the British Union of Fascists have declared their intent to march through the heart of London's East End, in full uniform before it's large Jewish population. Fearing violence, the Home Secretary has sent a police escort to help the march continue - but local communists, socialists, anarchists, Jews and labour activists have not been detered, and promise Mosley a fight."
 britain.29.a:0 "The antifascists turn the marchers back" 
 britain.29.b:0 "The blackshirts break through and march through the East End" 
 britain.29.c:0 "The antifascists turn the tables on the blackshirts" 
 
 britain.30.t:0 "The British Revolution"
 britain.30.d:0 "With London still recovering from the turmoil of last week's sudden and violent revolution, the Empire is still reeling. The unbelievable events in the British Metropole have left the extremities of our Empire, ideologically opposed to the new British government and constitutionally vexed, seeking to tread their own path."
 britain.30.a:0 "Traitors, the lot of them!" 
 
 britain.31.t:0 "North America goes its own way!"
 britain.31.d:0 "At some point before the storming of Buckingham Palace, the British Monarchy fled to Canada, which has now declared itself an independent constitutional monarchy and seized Newfoundland. In the Caribbean, a loose coalition of island states have formed up the West Indies Federation from our territories there."
 britain.31.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.32.t:0 "India goes its own way!"
 britain.32.d:0 "The conservative Anglo-Indian elite, now standing alone as the dominant minority in India, unable to accept the radical change in the regime of the metropole, have declared their independence from the Empire, with the smaller outposts in South Asia joining them willingly."
 britain.32.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.33.t:0 "The vultures pick over Africa"
 britain.33.d:0 "The Afrikaners of South Africa, never friends to the British, have declared their independence as a republic and seized Bechuanaland. To the north, the already quasi-independent Rhodesias have cast off the British shackles along with Nyasaland. Our colonies in West & East Africa have been seized by France & Italy, who will no doubt lead our territories to ruin."
 britain.33.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.34.t:0 "Oceania goes its own way!"
 britain.34.d:0 "Australia and New Zealand have proclaimed their independence as republics, and assumed control of our surrounding island colonies. While pledging they will return to the fold should 'civilised rule' ever be restored to Britain, it is looking unlikely."
 britain.34.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.35.t:0 "The vultures pick over the Near East"
 britain.35.d:0 "France has assumed control of all territories from the Suez Canal up to the border of their own Syria, while the Greeks of Cyprus have at last achieved their Enosis, and our remaining scattered territories did not last long before being snapped up by whichever backwater Sultanates held a grudge against our Empire."
 britain.35.a:0 "God help us..." 
 
 britain.36.t:0 "Britain proposes Syndicalisation"
 britain.36.d:0 "It is no secret the red tide of communism, socialism, and anarchism is on the rise in Ireland. Winning increasing seats in parliament and making themselves worryingly visible on the streets of Dublin, it seems only a matter of time until we are swamped by them. No doubt responsible for at least some of this, across the Irish Sea the British Federation has given us a tantalising offer. A United Irish Syndicate, on the same standing with Wales & Scotland. While this may seem to be vassalisation under any other name, the acquisition of the Six Counties is a long-coveted prize..."
 britain.36.a:0 "It seems this would be our best move" 
 britain.36.b:0 "Outrageous! Absolutely not" 
 
 britain.37.t:0 "Ireland refuses Syndicalisation!"
 britain.37.d:0 "The telegram has come back from Dublin, and Ireland has refused our generous offer for a united Irish syndicate!"
 britain.37.a:0 "Absurd! It may be time to start looking at other methods..." 
 
 britain.38.t:0 "Anthrax attack averted!"
 britain.38.d:0 "A dastardly British plan, intent on poisoning German cattle with anthrax, thus disseminating the plague to the rest of the German population, has thankfully been thwarted by our Abwehr agents. A number of disguised British special agents were detained near Greifswald, and after interrogation revealed the nature of their mission. Such barbarity in what we have been waging as a civilised war is almost unthinkable. Truly, the British can never be trusted."
 britain.38.a:0 "How could they even conceive of something like this?"
 
 britain.39.t:0 "Devastating Anthrax attack!"
 britain.39.d:0 "The unthinkable has befallen us. Agents of a hostile foreign government, Britain it would seem, have managed to infect massive quantities of German cattle with anthrax spores, which have begun to spread ceaselessly to the civilian population. Our attempts to contain the outbreak are ongoing, but the ramifications are immediate. Bodies line the streets, entire towns lie empty, with massive groups of refugees fleeing from the country to the cities in hope of safety, only exacerbating the food crisis brought on by the extermination of such large numbers of cattle. The army is in disarray. Our top scientists predict many of the infected areas will not be able to be inhabitable again for several decades. The Fuhrer has pledged retaliation, but in the state we are in, it seems doubtful that we will be able to."
 britain.39.a:0 "There are no words..."
 
 britain.40.t:0 "Failure of Operation Vegetarian"
 britain.40.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, our attempts at executing Operation Vegetarian have failed. With our on the ground personnel MIA and presumed in captivity, there is no doubt their air defences will be on high alert, preventing airborne shipments of the infected material being distributed. It won't be long before this comes out to the Intelligence communities of our fellow allied nations, and to the world - it is doubtful they will understand the direness of our situation."
 britain.40.a:0 "Drat."
 
 britain.41.t:0 "Operation Vegetarian succeeds!"
 britain.41.d:0 "Against all odds, the plan has worked! Anthrax-infected linseed cakes having been distributed to of German cattle, the poisoned meat has gone out to the German population, who have already begun dying in droves. It seems we have 'succeeded', but... the scenes we see now in Germany have lead many wonder to if this was the right course to take. Large numbers of the British population are themselves horrified by this choice, and we find ourselves condemned by our fellow Allied leaders. This may be a bridge too far."   
 britain.41.a:0 "May God forgive us."
 
 britain.42.t:0 "Assassination attempt averted"
 britain.42.d:0 "Men of the Führerbegleitkommando today apprehended two British agents and arrested a local collaborator near the Berghof, Hitler's personal residency in the Bavarian Alps. They are currently being subjected to questioning, but this would appear to be an attempted assassination! In response, vigilance has been raised and the SS, Abwehr, Gestapo and other security apparatus of the state are on high alert."
 britain.42.a:0 "That was close..."
 
 britain.43.t:0 "The Fuhrer is dead"
 britain.43.d:0 "Today, suddenly, while Adolf Hitler was talking his morning walk at the Berghof residence in the Bavarian Alps, he was shot and immediately struck dead by a sniper. Two British agents were soon after apprehended, with one being killed on the spot and the other taken into custody. All nearby towns have been put under lockdown, and a massive investigation has come underway to find every single traitor responsible for this. In accordance with the Fuhrer's will, Hermann Goering has stepped up as new Fuhrer of the German Reich. We are still preparing on how to best break this news to the German public."
 britain.43.a:0 "Without him, we may truly be lost."
 
 britain.44.t:0 "British Anthrax attack on Germany"
 britain.44.d:0 "The British, abandoning all codes and norms of civilised society and warfare, have done the unthinkable. Using anthrax-infected linseed cakes distributed to German cattle, they have wrought chemical warfare on a scale never seen before on this planet - as of yet, possible millions of Germans lie dead, soldiers and civilians alike. Britain's allies and enemies alike have condemned this senseless act of brutality. While the Fuhrer has issued vows of retaliation, his personal status and that of many other high-ranking Nazi officials remains unclear."
 britain.44.a:0 "How could they even think of such a thing?"
 
 britain.45.t:0 "Operation Foxley failure"
 britain.45.d:0 "Not even managing to lay eyes on Hitler, and apparently given away by a relative of the German villager aiding them, our two men sent in to Bavaria with the aim of killing the Fuhrer have been captured. German press releases show they have caught on to their mission and hightened security around Hitler - any such further assaults on the Fuhrer's person are now out of the question."
 britain.45.a:0 "It was always a long shot."
 
 britain.46.t:0 "Hitler assassinated!"
 britain.46.d:0 "A few days ago, suddenly, while Adolf Hitler was talking his morning walk at the Berghof residence in the Bavarian Alps, he was shot and immediately struck dead by a sniper. Two British agents were soon after apprehended, with one being killed on the spot and the other taken into custody. A massive investigation between all arms of the German state have descended on Bavaria, intent on rooting out any even remotely connected with the murder of their Fuhrer. Hermann Goering has been appointed the new Fuhrer in accordance with Hitler's will, and vows the war will continue."
 britain.46.a:0 "Unbelievable!"
 
 britain.47.t:0 "Britain demands North Atlantic possessions!"
 britain.47.d:0 "Britain has issued a demand, insisting that the present war situation requires their navy to assume control over our Atlantic Possessions, Iceland & the Faroe Islands. Greenland has, for whatever reason, been spared."
 britain.47.a:0 "We would not seem to have much choice..."
 britain.47.b:0 "Outrageous, absolutely not!"
 
 britain.48.t:0 "Denmark accedes!"
 britain.48.d:0 "Denmark has accepted our demands that we assume control over their North Atlantic Territories."
 britain.48.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 britain.49.t:0 "Denmark refuses!"
 britain.49.d:0 "Denmark has foolishly refused our demands that we assume control over their North Atlantic Territories."
 britain.49.a:0 "It seems this will need to be done the hard way, then"
 
 britain.50.t:0 "Reinhard Heydrich shot dead!"
 britain.50.d:0 "On his daily commute, Reinhard Heydrich was attacked by British-support Czech assassins, who assaulted him with machine gun fire & a small bomb. Despite surviving the intial attack, only a few days later in Hospital he died of his injuries. Two villages were been razed in the search for the perpetrators, who were eventually tracked down to a church in Prague, where after a two-hour gunfight committed suicide."
 britain.50.a:0 "Someone will pay for this."
 
 britain.51.t:0 "Heydrich survives assassination attempt"
 britain.51.d:0 "Reinhard Heydrich has been announced as  stable by the physicians at Bulovka Hospital, a week after an attempted assassination attempt by a group of ill-prepared assassins, who's guns jammed and had to resort to injuring the Protector with a bomb."
 britain.51.a:0 "Foolish Czechs, can't even shoot straight."
 
 britain.52.t:0 "Reinhard Heydrich killed in Prague!"
 britain.52.d:0 "On his daily commute, Reinhard Heydrich was attacked by British-support Czech assassins, who assaulted him with machine gun fire & a small bomb.

 britain.53.a:0 "It would have simply been too easy."
 
 britain.54.t:0 "Britain proposes peace"
 britain.54.d:0 "British Prime Minister, Lord Halifax, a prewar supporter of appeasement and always a reasoned voice in the British government, has extended us an offer of peace, finally seeing the situation for what it is after the fall of France. Under the peace which we initially declared ourselves open to, Britain shall be permitted to keep her colonial Empire and simply withdraw from the conflicts on the continent."
 britain.54.a:0 "Finally, they have seen reason."
 britain.54.b:0 "I don't think so."
 
 britain.55.t:0 "British and Germans sign peace!"
 britain.55.d:0 "British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden & his German counterpart, Joachim von Ribbentrop, met today in neutral Lisbon to sign an armistice paving the way for a full peace agreement, withdrawing Britain from the war in Europe and allowing her to maintain all her possessions. The French, Polish and other governments in exile have declared their dismay at this situation, and are predicted to relocate to America from London following the armistice."
 britain.55.a:0 "Europe is on it's own."
 
 britain.56.t:0 "Germans reject our offer!"
 britain.56.d:0 "The Germans have refused our offer of peace, saying it is too late now for amends."

 britain.60.t:0 "Italians present African demands"
 britain.60.d:0 "The Italians have put forward their interests in Africa towards us, and are in fact more managed than we would have initially expected."

 britain.63.t:0 "Italians present Balkan Agenda"
 britain.63.d:0 "The Italians have presented their interests in the Balkans, primarily concerned with cementing Italian control over the Adriatic Sea. It is Dalmatia, promised to them in the last War, but instead given to Yugoslavia, that is at the centre of their demands."
 britain.63.a:0 "A narrow strip of the Yugoslav coast? That's all? Easy."

 britain.65.a:0 "Is this Balkan speck really so valuable to them?"
 
 britain.66.t:0 "Britain & Italy present Demands"
 britain.66.d:0 "Our worst fears have materialised - on the tails of recent talks and international closeness, we have been approached by British diplomats, who, on behalf of Italy, are requesting we cede our Adriatic coastline. The alternative, while going unmentioned as of now, is obvious."
 britain.66.a:0 "It is this, or a war we cannot win."

 britain.69.d:0 "Coming after the last few months of Italo-British Cooperation and a concerted effort by both countries to maintain peace, amicability and brotherly warmth in Europe, Italy has taken the final step by joining in Britain's alliance - an echo of the old Entente, as many say, much to German's dismay yet again."

 britain.71.t:0 "The Peking Plan"
 britain.71.d:0 "Organised in early 1939, the Peking Plan was an agreement in the case of a German invasion of Poland, that instead of fighting a surely lost battle against the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic Sea, they should reloate to Britain and join our forces in aid of retaking their motherland. Those that have managed to make the ship have now arrived in London harbour."
 britain.71.a:0 "We'll put them to good use."
 
 britain.72.t:0 "Britain Reinforces the Far East"
 britain.72.d:0 "Capping off several months of fortification and military development in th Far East, a dozen new divisions have arrived from across the Empire to garrison Hong Kong, Singapore and Rangoon. This is sure to ruffle Japanese feathers."

 britain.75.t:0 "Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938"
 britain.75.d:0 "The Anglo-Irish Trade war has been a sordid affair raging from 1933, arising from Irish refusals to reimburse land annuities from financial loans granted to Irish tenant farmers. This breach of the 1921 Treaty lead to a breakdown in relations, and subsequent trade restrictions from both countries. But the last few months have seen a build-up of reconciliatory legislation, beginning with the Coal-Cattle pact three years ago, and now with this treaty declaring a formal end to the state of affairs."
 britain.75.a:0 "Huzzah!"
 
 britain.76.t:0 "Imperial Conference 1937"
 britain.76.d:0 "The irregular Imperial Conference, last held in 1932, has been adjourned in London today. Provoked primarily by unfolding events on the continent, key issues were Foreign Affairs & Defence, leading to a debate on Dominion Foreign Policy in relation to that of the British Government, given New Zealand's strong feelings regarding the Italian Invasion of Abyssinia. One final, and rather major matters is that of the Imperial Federation - talk of the neccessity to federalise the Empire to counter the growing independence of the Dominions and the allegedly inevitable collapse of the Empire as a world power due to the growing power of the Soviet Union & United States has been going around in many circles since the turn of the century, but now it has achieved official attention."

 britain.82.d:0 "Representatives from across the Empire in Ottowa today after months of grueling negotiation, back-and-forth and debate have at last signed the Constitution of the Imperial Federation, bringing this years-long ambition to unite and federalise the British Empire as a single superstate into law.

Since the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company itself was founded in Mexico, under Mexican laws we cannot intervene directly, however negotiation has at least resulted in the repayment of some debts left over from the Mexican Revolution."
 britain.83.a:0 "Who do they think they are?"  
 
 britain.84.t:0 "Irish Constitution of 1937"
 britain.84.d:0 "Ireland has declared a new Constitution, setting aside the old 'Irish Free State' moniker for simply Ireland, or Eire. No mention in this constitution is made to the British Commonwealth, of which Ireland is still technically a Dominion, and some readers find it to be of a distinctly territorial tone, in respect to Northern Ireland. The British Government has sent a clarifying communique reaffirming the position of Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom."
 britain.84.a:0 "Worrying."  
 
 britain.85.t:0 "José Luis Díez Incident"
 britain.85.d:0 "A Republican Spanish Destroyer, the José Luis Díez, previously used to transport refugees, has been caught in the Strait of Gibraltar impersonating the British HMS Grenville, and using that cover to attack Nationalist shipping. Discovered and forced to harbour by the British Navy, she was secretly repaired by the Republican-sympathetic Gibraltarian working class, before being sent out again to repeat their ruse. It did not last long however, and the ship was again caught, purposefully beached and the crews repatriated to the Spanish Republicans."

 britain.87.d:0 "The Shah of Iran has been courting agents representing our enemies for too long.  The time has come to ensure that fascist influence does not propagate any further and ruin our security in the Middle-East.  A new route for essential lend-lease material will also be opened to the Soviet Union after Iran is secured.  We must see if it is in our interest to involve the Soviets in this operation, and if they are willing to assist if we decide to operate with them.  The occupation zones will be pre-determined."

 britain.91.d:0 "The British have approached us with a proposal to act against and occupy Iran for the rest of the duration of the war in what they call "Operation Countenance".  They seek to secure Iran to better facilitate lend-lease operations to the Soviet Union.  Their other motives are unclear; though securing Iran's oilfields seems evident enough to partially warrant their invasion.  This will surely allow us to fullfill our strategic goal of acquiring a warm-water naval base, however.  They have informed us that they will initiate the operation when both parties are ready.  How shall we respond?"
 britain.91.a:0 "Let's oblige them."
 britain.91.a.tt:0 "Iran will be divided evenly, with the North-West being occupied by us and the South-East being occupied by the British, with the Persian Gulf port in Khuzestan falling under our control.
