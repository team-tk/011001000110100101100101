  mexico_calles.1.t:0 "REBELS ATTACK TRAIN!"
  mexico_calles.1.d:0 "A Mexico City-Veracruz train was ambushed yesterday by dissidents, killing multiple PRM Mexican politicians. The train was ambushed at a bridge, that was rigged with explosives, ruling out a bandit robbery as the motive for the attack. The train was found by officials completely destroyed by fire, leaving little behind for investigators. It is not known if the explosion set fire to the cars, or they were set on fire by the attackers to destroy evidence. Mexico has been facing increasing political polarization, and now it seems political extremists are now resorting to violence."

Mexico's leftists have accused Calles of trying to ferment dissent among the right wing against President Cardenas, whom he calls a communist, and possibly force the country into a civil war. When the Mexican authorities stormed the rancho, they arrested Calles laying in his bed, reading a spanish Translation of Hitler's book "Mein kampf." Calles was then forced onto a plane in the dead of night, heading for Houston, Texas. Calles arrived in the morning, and is said to be on his way to San Diego where he will live with his sister.\n A cache of weapons, presumably for supplying rebels, were also recovered."

They have blatantly broken many of our laws before, and dealing with them will receive little to no backlash among Mexicans. It is best to nationalize the oil company under the constitutional statute that asserts our ownership over all natural resources. Oil nationalization would help fund our country's industrialization, and if war were to happen we would stand to make substantial profit."

This disproportionately effects UK and Dutch companies, who are demanding their governments go to war.

They accuse him of tampering with Mexican politics by using his media monopoly to turn Mexicans against the United Kingdom. However, our sources say that Jenkins is merely refusing to publish most anti-German films in Mexico,with recent events backing the prudent move. The previous film published was "The Lion has Wings", a movie about the RAF raid on the Kiel Canal, drew such anger that Mexican cinemas were forced to remove the movie. William Jenkins, as far as we know, did nothing expressly wrong if pro-UK films were unpopular with Mexcian audiences. This situation could also be used to expel more than just Jenkins or the English, we would have an excuse to expel all of the lawbreakers in the nation to save face as we would not be laying blame on any one party.

Maximino is a known axis sympathizer, and is said to have a photo of Mussolini hanging over his bed at his masnion in Pueblo. It is obvious that Maximino is using his leverage over Jenkins to stop non-fascist influence from gaining a foothold in Mexico. Pro-UK movies however are extremely unpopular with Mexican audiences and prompted Mexican cinemas to stop showing them in some instances. The decision to allow pro-UK movies would please the United Kingdom, but not the Mexican movie goer.

Díaz was found unconscious, intoxicated, and suffered blunt force trauma. Diaz later died from his injuries at Los Angeles General Hospital. Police scoured the city for the culprits and arrested the leader of the 1th street gang, Hank Leyvas, his girlfriend Dora Barrios, and 1 other Mexican-Americans out of 600 Mexican Americans rounded up by LAPD. Hank denies any tie to the murder. Tensions have been running high in Los Angeles between Angelenos and Pachucos, otherwise known as zoot suiters, and it seems the tensions won't be resolved any time soon."

They found a party near the site of the attack, and assuming it was a rival gang they confronted the partiers. A fight broke out between the gang and the partiers, lasting about 10 minutes. By morning, the body of Diaz was found. The coronor report states that Dia'z injuries are consistent with being hit by a car. The prosecution put forward E. Duran Ayres, chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, to state that Mexicans as a whole are bloodthirsty and contain a biological urge to kill past down from their Aztec ancestors."

Servicemen were seen raiding bars theaters and cafes to drag out Mexican youths, some of them children, to be stripped naked and beaten as their clothes were burned. A smaller mob has descended on the Black neighborhood of Watts, but there is no word on the scale of the damage done there.

Fransisco Mugica is left wing, and more aligned with socialist ideals. Choosing Mugica would be a risk if popularity for socialist ideals are low.

Almazán is known more for being a noted businessman rather than a military figure, and draws in support mainly from wealthy Mexicans. However, his support among the working poor is abysmal as he is seen as offering nothing to them. Almazán's foreign policy is noticeably pro-US and further alianates average Mexicans. Amaro however is a famous military figure, and draws respect from the nationalists. Despite this, Almazán is seen as the inevitable choice for the right wing candidacy and Amaro's bid is quickly losing support to Almazán's campaign through a series of high profile defections. It is clear that Amaro will inevitably lose as Juan is backed by US interests and people find voting for a candidate that the US would try to overthrow is a fool's errand. However, there are people among the fascist cabal in Mexican politics who want to ensure that Almazán never lives to see election day. Maximino Ávila Camacho, brother to Manuel Ávila Camacho, has devised a plan to assassinate Juan Almazán at Plueba by staging an train accident."

His supporters have accused the PRI itself of orchestrating the derailment. Previously, Almazán was attacked by assassins wearing sarapes that hid machine guns while staying at the house of Fransisco Barbosa. His campaign claims he was attacked by an army of 100 assassins, and that he had to be stopped from running outside to fight them.
