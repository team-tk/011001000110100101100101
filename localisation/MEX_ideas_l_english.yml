  MEX_constable_army3_desc:0 "Mexico's army have long been focused on internal policing and lacked the internal structure to face outside threats effectively. During this era, the Caudillos posed a serious threat to the national peace and forced the Mexican government to send the military on engineering projects to not only tie up manpower so the Caudillos could not form a rebellion but also improve national infrastructure at the same time."

  MEX_embargo_desc:0 "The embargo was a serious blow to Mexico and quickly destroyed the moment of pride when Mexico siezed the oil from the British who had long abused Mexico's hospitality.

  MEX_small_aviation_industry_desc:0 "Mexico's aviation industry had no shortage of good designers to design aircraft. However, the industry suffered from a lack of ability to mass produce these planes due to lack of not only machines, but qualified engineers. Mexico's biggest obstacle in fielding its own designs was the slow production time."
