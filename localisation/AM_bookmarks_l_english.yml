 OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_NAME:0 "Operation Barbarossa"
 OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "With the start of Operation Barbarossa on the 22nd of June 1941, Germany has officialy broken the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The first phase was the first and only attack along the entire frontline, and captured a huge stroke of USSR territories. The German army seems unstoppable and the Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 4,000 Soviet Aircraft while only losing 80 of their own. Libya is still holding strong and so far the Soviets seem unable to resist the German Panzers. Japan stands poised to attack the allies in the Pacific... "
ENG_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It has become clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
FFR_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "With The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely have proven to be of no benefit. Now that France has fallen, what will happen next?"
FRA_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "With The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace.

Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely have proven to be of no benefit. Now that France has fallen, what will happen next?"
GER_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Eight years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Who will be able to stop them?"
JAP_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
ITA_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
SOV_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
USA_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
OTHER_OPERATION_BARBAROSSA_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 
 ###1914
 
 THE_GREAT_WAR_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "For the first time in one hundred years in europe a conflict is brewing which will take more lives than any other time in history and last an unusually long time. For the first time in history man and machine will be combined inventing dozens of new methods to kill and destroy, this is the Great War."
 GER_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The German Empire was created at Versailles in 1871 with blood and iron after the defeat of France a year previously. But following the rise of Wilhelm II whom sacked Bismarck and his attempts at status quo Germany soon found itself with potential enemies on two fronts. These facts could not have been far from the German military’s mind as 1914 came: as Chief of Staff von Moltke put it - "war is inevitable, and the sooner the better". Time is running out. Can the 'place in the sun' and Germany's dominance in the world still be achieved?"
 AUS_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Dual Monarchy had been created in 1867 from a compromise between Emperor Franz Josef and the nobility of Hungary. A patchwork empire, it was composed of eleven major ethnic groups. the empire centred around the capital, Vienna, and held together to a great degree by the strength of Emperor Franz Josef’s character. To limit Russian influence in the Balkans, Austria-Hungary aligned itself with Germany in 1879, and then with Italy in 1882 to form the Triple Alliance. However, with Germany the dominant party in the alliance, Austria-Hungary would find its foreign policy wishes subordinated to the desires of its senior partner. The rulers of Austria-Hungary."
 TUR_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "By the 18th century the Ottoman Empire was shrinking with its power eroded by a loss of internal authority and the expansionist ambitions of the European powers. The 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts at reform, including the creation of an executive branch, and a centralised government. But also witnessed the Ottoman Empire's substantial territorial decline. Meanwhile, the Turkish government was largely unable to collect its own taxes and the empire's communications and infrastructure remained primative, causing many to refer to Turkey as the "sick man of Europe". Can the Ottoman Empire modernise and survive or will it pass into the bygone era to where many argue it belongs?"
 RUS_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Russia's eyes have fallen on the Balkans and Constantinople, which controls the vital sea route to the outside world. To support this ambition, Russia has the largest army in the world and a rapidly modernising industrial base. However, for all its strength Russia suffers from dangerous weaknesses and severe unrest amongst the populous. Some members of the Tsar's council advise that a "short, victorious war" might rally the people and distract them from their woes. But if the war went badly for Russia, could the Tsar's rule survive the consequences?"

 ENG_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "At the turn of the century, all appeared well for the British Empire - covering two-fifths of the world's land surface, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, policed by the most professional army in the world and guarded by the mightiest fleet ever built. But beneath the assurances of imperial grandeur lay insecurity about the future: economically and industrially, the United States was outperforming the British and the Germans had commenced an ominous fleet building program to challenge the Royal Navy's dominance of the seas."
 FRA_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Once the greatest Power of Europe, France is now a troubled country. Economically, she has been overtaken by many of her rivals. A declining birthrate seems to promise further decline, and in an age of mass armies might prove a fatal weakness. Politically, the Third Republic is unstable. On the international scene, the defeat by Prussia in 1871 and Germany's occupation of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine is a festering sore, and demands for 'revanche' - revenge - against Germany remain strong."
 USA_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Since gaining independence from Great Britain in 1783 the United States and its people have mostly concerned themselves with their own continent, and to a lesser extent Central and South America, following the declaration of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Following the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War the United States has emerged as a world power, but with its very small army, is still not considered a 'Great Power' in the European sense, although it has vast potential to do so. This potential comes from the population and vast economy that in is greater than Britain, France, Russia and Germany combined."
 OTHER_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."
 
 ITA_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "22 years ago, Italy halfheartedly joined the Triple Alliance with Germany and the hated Austrians to spite France's gains in Tunisia. Today, the alliance is the most shaky in Europe. With her old alliance, Italy has the chance to get Savoy, Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia for herself. However, the Entente would provide the Dalmatian coast- and seems much more able to do so. \n\nItaly still has time before the war to make a decision. But on which side does her fate lay?"

SER_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Balkan Wars saw a massive success for Serbia, as well as their most important ally in Greece. The hard part, however has just begun: The Habsburgs still hold the region of Bosnia, as well as other South Slavic territories. Worse yet, they see Serbia as a troublemaker, and would be more than happy to rid the world of the state at a moment's notice. \n\nFortunately, Russia seems to have taken a liking to Serbia, though perhaps for malicious reasons. If Tsar Peter utilizes this, the world may change forever..."

 BUL_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was wrong to trust the Greeks and the Romanians to stay out of the inevitable conflict between themselves and Serbia, and are down to the lowest territorial extent since independence from the Ottoman Empire. It is unlikely they will be fooled twice. Russia seems next in the line of false friends, seeking only to profit from the state. \n\nThe only countries that seem to genuinely have Bulgaria's best interests at heart are Germany and Austria. Perhaps it's time for a new alliance?"

 MEX_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "While initially it seemed Madero's victory in the first phase of the Mexican Civil War was the end of it, in 1913 he was deposed, killed, and replaced by one of his former generals, Victoriano Huerta. Huerta is not popular or terribly competent, and few see him lasting long in command of the nation. \n\nStill, there is no agreement among the Mexican populace as to who is to be the next leader. Some rally behind causes as extreme as Communism or Military Dictatorship. Will Civil War rear its ugly head again?"

 JAP_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Unfortunately, it turns out Emperor Taisho is cursed with mental afflictions which have severely impacted his ability to rule. Fortunately for Japan, his ministers and other members of the Imperial court have begun to administrate Japan, whose public is getting its first taste of liberty. \n\nBut still, what of the war in Europe? Would it be to Japan's benefit to throw in? After all, the British-Japanese alliance is tenuous at best, and Japan may be better off simply waiting to choose which side will serve its interests."

 BEL_THE_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."

 ### 1910
 
 BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_NAME:0 "The Balkan Powder Keg"
 BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Although constantly arguing over some new crises since the Vienna Conference a major European war has been avoided on the European continent for almost a hundred years. But increasingly so in the past few decades tensions have been increasingly rising in the Balkans with various empires seekning to secure their dominance in the region. It will only takes one small spark to blow the Balkan Powder keg."

 OTHER_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict that spans across several continents around the world."
 
 ITA_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Italy is  the smallest third of the Triple Alliance, an alliance with which she has little faith in. Austria-Hungary, Italy's natural rival, is now a friend in the world of treaties but still a rival in practical terms. After all, Italian Irredentism still decrees the Austrian-held Dalmatian coast as Italian. For now, however, there are more pressing matters. \n\nWar plans with the Ottoman Turks are already being drawn up. The government predicts a short, decisive war. Italy shall prove her power."

SER_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Serbia is seen by outsiders as a backwater, minor nation. Nothing more than a pawn in a great game that the world's empires are playing as each other. Of course, the empires of the world may learn sooner than they think that the Serbs are destined for greater things. \n\nCurrently, most Serbs live outside our borders, in Turkish or Austrian territory. If we are to make a deal with the devil- the Bulgarians- the Serbs may begin their road for glory by way of full Serbian unification."

 BUL_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Bulgaria has already made a name for itself through successful conflicts against the Serbs and outmaneuvering the Ottoman Empire to unify with Eastern Rumelia. Of course, now the state stands at a more uncomfortable position. The Turks seem unwilling to put up any more Bulgarian territory for grabs, and the Russians are slowly withdrawing their support. \n\nPerhaps it is not too late to mend fences with Serbia? After all, a Bulgaria with strong friends could be a surprising menace."

 MEX_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "The Mexico of 1910 is a strange case indeed. The Porfiriato has been a great boon to Mexico since 1876, but now that the heat has been turned up, it seems President Diaz's time may be limited. Of course, the Government sees this as biting the hand. \n\nFrancisco Madero is actively and obviously plotting against the Diaz government. If he finds himself ambitious enough, he may see Mexico in his own back pocket yet."

 JAP_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "In just under 50 years, Japan has turned from a backwards despotate ruled by a Shogun to a proper modern Empire, just as powerful as any country Europe has to offer. Emperor Meiji is to thank for it, but sadly he is both old and diseased- and can't possibly live much longer. \n\nBefore Crown Prince Yoshihito takes the crown, there are a few more matters to settle, however. The elderly emperor must decide where Japan stands with Russia, and what to do with the Korean vassal."

 BEL_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Protected by the British, seen by the German as a backdoor leading to Paris avoiding the fortified French military's concentration along the Franco-German border, the Kingdom of Belgium is in a tricky situation.\n\nKing Albert I will have a difficult choice to make, either stand against the Kaiser Wilhelm II and stood side by side with Entente or either let the German troops walk in its territories and take a different course of action."

 HOL_BALKAN_POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Since the Second Hague Conference in 1907, the Netherlands do everything to avoid a Political Alliance with another European Empire.\n\nAs the drums of war resound to the gates of Amsterdam and despite their strong policy of neutrality, the peaceful mill country could soon find itself back to the wall having to make a choice that could forever change the future of the Dutch Empire.\n\nNo one knows how the fiercely patriotic Queen Wilhelmina will react..."

 ### 1936
 
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Adolf Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is increasingly drawn beyond German borders. Benito Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures. Meanwhile in Asia, the Empire of Japan is poised to attack China. Not even a generation has passed since the end of the Great War and the world has apparently been doused in gasoline again. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundations of its great empire were shaken to the core. A generation of its finest young men were lost on the battlefields of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts were accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still fresh in the memory, it is now facing up to the prospect of another war. It is becoming more apparent that there is unlikely to be 'Peace for Our Time'."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France is on the road to recovery thanks to its strong economy supported by German war reparations. However, the 'Great Depression' has still affected the country and the new German regime has shown little interest in continuing to pay the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWith political unrest at home, the words of Marshal Ferdinand Foch when the treaty was signed "This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years" appear to be an omen. Those 20 years are rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new proud Germany has arisen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dissolved and replaced by Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich'. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the 'Great Depression' and mass unemployment is a thing of the past.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. With rumours of German rearmament, could there be more conflict on the horizon?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the back of the rise of Fascism, Italy expects a new glorious era. Its forces are currently 'persuading' Ethiopia to be added to the growing Italian colonial empire, but do Benito Mussolini's ambitions stop there?\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean Basin has surely always been her destiny? With a new order of things seemingly taking shape in Europe, when the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or run the risk of being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. 'Hokushin-ron', the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favoured by the Army and calls for an advance into Russia and China. 'Nanshin-ron', the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the resource rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target.\n\nJapan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are in urgent need of resources and time appears to be running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""A spectre is haunting Europe - The spectre of communism."\nWhen the dust had settled after the Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what had once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid state industrialisation and collectivism followed, often at a great cost in human lives.\n\nNow the Soviet Union is faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west and a belligerent Japan to the east. There are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with as well..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolationism at the end of the Great War and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the 'Great Depression' in 1929.\n\nThe American policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tension is increasing both in Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstorm whether or not it wants to be."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, both great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance their ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Following centuries in which the nation was divided between three empires, Poland now stands proudly independent once again. However its political position is not an easy one.\n\nTo the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten its humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nTo the west, the German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" for his people and that the former German land now under Polish control will be the first step in him achieveing it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a British colony and left it as a nation. Born in the sacrifices of the Passchendaele mud, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage.\n\nHobbled by the 'Great Depression' and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this relatively new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War with their blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipoli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it.\n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, most likely about to be drawn into more conflict in distant Europe, or should its focus be on the threat that is looming much closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The military spent most of the war chasing German forces around their African colonies with limited success.\n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in that think South Africa shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualtie rates in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the forces fighting overseas and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the populace of New Zealand peer anxiously at world events, for this time the threat of war looms ever closer to their own homeland..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 'crown jewel' of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange mix of imperial power and powerlessness. A small band of elite British civil servant's rule over a vast sub-continent with a populace of hundreds of millions of subjects. From these ranks they recruit the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndias leaders hoped that the sacrifices she made in the last war would help her gain independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been dampened. With a new war looming, many Indians believe that the time has come to take freedom - by whatever means are necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful, and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War losing two thirds of its territory in the Treaty of Trianon. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe.\n\nAs the political climate in Europe shifts, it may be time to finally right the wrongs of the past and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side in the Great War, and as a result, gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the desires of those countries that were forced to cede land to regain what they felt was rightfully theirs, Romania has created a web of alliances across the Balkans. However, in recent years she has mostly concerned herself with domestic matters and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse.\n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the merging of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander, combined with growing pressure internally from nationalists and externally from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and allowed for a re-evaluation of their political and strategic position."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government.\n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists?

 GER_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."

 USA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 OTHER_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
