 artillery1_md:0 "Modern Artillery Upgrade I"
 artillery2_md:0 "Artillery I"
 artillery2_md_desc:0 "With more modern materials and mechanisms, howitzers and field guns from the Great War can be rechambered and modernized for modern warfare."
 artillery3_md:0 "Modern Artillery Upgrade II"
 artillery3_md_desc:0 "Upgrading old pieces can only get us so far. New howitzer designs will be needed, taking advantage of new hydraulic recoil devices and longer barrels."
 artillery4_md:0 "Modern Artillery Upgrade III"
 artillery4_md_desc:0 "To enable heavier guns on lighter carriages, muzzle brakes can be included in howitzer designs."
 artillery5_md:0 "Artillery IV"
 artillery5_md_desc:0 "Developing light-weight artillery capable of being broken down for transport will make it possible to bring artillery support to areas previously difficult to teach."
 artillery6_md:0 "Modern Artillery Upgrade IV"
 
 rocket_artillery2_md:0 "Modern Rocket Artillery Upgrade I"
 rocket_artillery2_md_desc:0 "Self-propelled artillery utilizing multiple rockets will be able to cause large-scale destruction rapidly, while maintaining mobility to avoid counter-fire."
 rocket_artillery3_md:0 "Modern Rocket Artillery Upgrade II"
 rocket_artillery3_md_desc:0 "Sacrificing range for impact, we can mount heavier rockets on larger vehicles. Operating in teams, these artillery batteries can cooperate to reload and relocate quickly."
 rocket_artillery4_md:0 "Rocket Artillery III"
 rocket_artillery4_md_desc:0 "Spin-stabilized rockets can increase the range of lighter artillery batteries."
 
 antiair2_md:0 "Modern Anti-Air Upgrade"
 antiair2_md_desc:0 "With faster reloading mechanisms, anti-air guns carrying large rounds can still maintain necessary firing rates."
 antiair3_md:0 "Anti-Air II"
 antiair3_md_desc:0 "To target high-flying aircraft, longer cartridges and barrels will be needed on anti-air guns."
 antiair4_md:0 "Modern Anti-Air Upgrade II"
 antiair4_md_desc:0 "As radar systems improve, employing radar direction of anti-aircraft guns becomes more viable. Keeping up with this technology will allow us to make some of the most accurate anti-air systems available."
 antiair5_md:0 "Modern Anti-Air Upgrade III"
 antiair5_md_desc:0 "Combining modern systems of radar, computerization and autoloaders will be necessary to react quickly against faster aircraft."
 antiair6_md:0 "Anti-Air V"
 antiair6_md_desc:0 "Surface-to-air missiles are the future of anti-aircraft warfare. Developing a mobile platform for these should be our next goal."
 
 antitank2_md:0 "Modern Anti-Tank Upgrade"
 antitank2_md_desc:0 "The importance of effective anti-tank weapons was established in the Great War. Introducing a new generation of these weapons will be necessary to combat modern tank designs."
 antitank3_md:0 "Anti-Tank II"
 antitank3_md_desc:0 "Most anti-tank guns are so far fairly light. Larger caliber guns will be required to combat heavier tanks with sloped armor."
 antitank4_md:0 "Modern Anti-Tank Upgrade II"
 antitank4_md_desc:0 "HEAT (high-explosive anti-tank) rounds can be used in anti-tank artillery to make up for limited muzzle velocity."
 antitank5_md:0 "Modern Anti-Tank Upgrade III"
 antitank5_md_desc:0 "New versatile anti-tank guns employing armor-piercing discarding sabot shots can penetrate the armor of nearly any tank."
 antitank6_md:0 "Anti-Tank V"
 antitank6_md_desc:0 "By combining different kinds of new ammunition technology with guns with higher muzzle velocities, we can be prepared for whatever new armor our enemies may develop."
