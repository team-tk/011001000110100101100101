 spain.1.t:0 "Military uprising!"
 spain.1.d:0 "A group of powerful generals in the Armed Forces have issued a pronunciamento, denouncing the current government of Spain! They have launched a right-wing coup with the support of conservative monarchists and the clergy. A significant portion of the military has sided with these Nationalists, but so far they have failed to capture any of Spain's major cities with the exception of Sevilla.\n\nLeftist volunteers are meanwhile flocking to the banners of the Republican government, ready to support it against the rebels. These loyalists may be poorly trained, but no one can question their enthusiasm.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 spain.1.a:0 "The Military!"
 spain.1.b:0 "The Government!"
 spain.10.t:0 "Communist uprising!"
 spain.10.d:0 "After the electoral victory of the CEDA in the elections of february, several measures were taken to put an end to political violence. That involved a broad policial operation against violent left-wing and syndical groups.\n\nConsiderating this measures as 'fascist', the radical part of the Socialist Party has launched an insurrection against the governmnt, even bigger that the Revolution of 1934. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the government. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe right-wing party Falange has offered Gil-Robles a coalition government with Rivera as president to get the support of the right. The battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"

 spain.2.t:0 "Seek International Support?"
 spain.2.d:0 "The coup has not been a complete success, but Carlists, Falangists and the Confederation of the Autonomous Right have managed to mobilize a large part of the army to overthrow the Republic, which has too long allowed our proud Christian nation to fall apart into anarchy. The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."
 spain.2.a:0 "Let's request equipment and munitions."
 spain.2.b:0 "Spain must be won with Spanish blood!"
 spain.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilization of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Spanish people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavor, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."

 spain.4.t:0 "Nationalist Spain Wants Our Help"
 spain.4.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War has become a sort of microcosm for our view of the global situation: Communists and liberals seek to destroy old values, and we take up arms to revive them. It is not surprising that the Nationalists in Spain have reached out to us and others to equip them for the coming conflict."
 spain.4.a:0 "We promise to send what we can."
 spain.4.b:0 "If they lack the strength to seize power, they do not deserve it."
 spain.5.t:0 "Republican Spain Wants Our Help"
 spain.5.d:0 "The attempt to overthrow the Second Spanish Republic is a clear signal that the fascists will not allow the flowers of progress to grow even where they naturally take root. The Republicans and their allies, a mix of democrats, communists and anarchists, have turned to us and other parts of the international community for help. Many nations who claim to defend democracy and liberty have withheld their support for fear of being dragged into the war. How do we respond?"
 spain.5.a:0 "Promise them to send arms and equipment."

 spain.8.b:0 "Keep current location"
 spain.9.t:0 "Spanish Election of 1936"
 spain.9.d:0 "The Second Republic has proven to be a fragile existence. Manuel Azaña can be president with the backing of the Popular Front, a broad coalition of left-wing groups supported by republicans, communists and anarchists.\n\nBut the right-wing opposition, encompassing conservatives, monarchists and fascists, is also beginning to unite for the cause of bringing down the Popular Front. Whichever coalition falls apart, their opponents are likely to take advantage of their internal conflicts to launch a revolution. This election is not the final test Spain will have to endure to resolve this conflict."

They control the militias that compose our army and most of the factories.\n\nThe Socialist party has demanded the President of the Republic the formation of a new government, led by Largo Caballero.

 spain.12.b:0 "Let him stay."
 spain.13.t:0 "Violence in the streets"
 spain.13.d:0 "Political violence is a common problem in Spain, but since the elections of february, the problem has worsened. Communist and falangist fight an urban war while the moderates ask the government to interviene.\n\nWe can send the police to stop the fights, however, that might anger the radical movements even more. What shall we do?"
 spain.13.a:0 "Stop this!"

 spain.27.t:0 "Victory of the Popular Front"
 spain.27.d:0 "Last night, after a close campaign full of violence and physical attacks from both contenders, the initial results have been published. They give a close victory for the Popular Front, the coalition of left-wing republicans, socialists and communists. The liberals and the right have denounced that the leftist violence has deterred them from campaigning, while the victorious left joyusly proclaims victory and claims the inmediate formation of a new government headed by Azaña, the most important republican leader at this moment.

 spain.29.d:0 "After 4 years of a moderate government, Spain prepares for another electoral process. Even though extremist groups have exercised some violence during last days, the main contenders are clear: The CEDA, led by Gil-Robles, with a christian-democrat programme, and the alliance between the leftist republicans and the new PSOE of Prieto, with a social-democrat programme.

 spain.32.t:0 "The Spanish Republic asks for help!"
 spain.32.d:0 "The Spanish Republic is in danger! France has always supported democracy and a nationalist victory would mean three fascist neighbours, which would be very dangerous.

 spain.55.d:0 "After the disastrous war of the Rif of 1921, the popularity of the king Alfonso XII was very low. It further dropped when the king authorized the formation of a military dictatorship under general Miguel Primo de Rivera, ignoring his own Constitution. This led to a hatred of the king among the majority of the Spanish society. As a result, in 1931, two years after the end of the dictatorship, the Second Republic was proclaimed and the king Alfonso XII fled the country. \n\nThe first republican government was led by Manuel Azaña and it was a coalition between republicans, liberals and socialists. It passed important reforms ( Agrarian, Military and Education ) which angered the right and, due to their slow application, the left. Disputes between socialists and republicans led to the breakup of the government and the right-wing CEDA victory in the 1933 election. \n\nThe president Alcalá-Zamora, afraid of the CEDA, appointed the liberal Alejandro Lerroux head of government, although he had to admit some CEDA misters. This provoked a socialist revolution in 1934 that was put down by the army. After one year of relative stability, Lerroux resigned due to a corruption scandal. Alcalá-Zamora refused to allow a CEDA government and disbanded the parliament, calling for new elections in february of 1936. In the meanwhile, a provisional government run by the liberal veteran Manuel Portela, friend of Zamora, ran the country."
