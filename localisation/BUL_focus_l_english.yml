  BUL_restore_the_bulgarian_army_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War, our army has been a disgrace to the community. Part of this is to be blamed on the peace treaty, but also on our lack of doing something about it. We should reorganise the army."
  BUL_greater_bulgaria_desc:0 "Ever since the Great War we've had the concept of a Greater Bulgaria. Now we're an independent and strong power, we finally have the ability to pursue that."
  BUL_sign_salonika_agreement_desc:0 "One of the first things we should do is cancel the restrictions placed on us. We can do so by signing a treaty with the Greeks and the other members of the Balkan Entente."
  BUL_ignore_treaty_neuilly_sur_seine_desc:0 "The results of our loss during World War I are still apparent. As opposed to following Western order however, we should attempt to secretly re-arm ourselves."
  BUL_vmz_sopot_desc:0 "VMZ Sopot can provide us with weapons for the infantry, munitions and artillery. VMZ Sopot might be crucial to the restoration of the Bulgarian army."
  BUL_treaty_of_friendship_yugoslavia_desc:0 "We should start restoring relations with Yugoslavia. We are much alike and they could be a valuable ally in what's to come."
  BUL_expand_facilities_desc:0 "In order to further fight the crisis, it'd best that we improve the industry by means of constructing more factories, and as a result, enlist more people."
  BUL_rearm_ourselves_desc:0 "As part of our plan of re-arming, the first thing to do is to enhance our military production. We do this by building more factories and enlisting more people."

  BUL_rearm_airforce_desc:0 "Re-arming the Bulgarian airforce should be one of our top priorities. If we are to prepare for an upcoming conflict, then the airforce is crucial to it."
  BUL_fighter_focus_desc:0 "We should focus our efforts on the fighters, as opposed to bombers. We need the fighters to rule the skies."
  BUL_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Instead of a light airforce, we should focus on bombers and destroy the enemy from the air."
  BUL_air_innovations_desc:0 "We should update our tactics in the sky, and correct our mistakes of the Great War."
  BUL_research_treaty_with_italy_desc:0 "Italy is one of the leading innovators when it comes to sky warfare. We should request their help in the updating of our airforce."
  BUL_airfields_for_germany_desc:0 "It might be beneficial for both us and the Germans that we permit the Germans to use our airbases. For if we are in favour with the Germans, they might reward us."
  BUL_bulgarian_arms_desc:0 "Bulgarian gun manufacturing needs to be restarted. It collapsed as a result of our failure during the Great War, and now we can solve it."
  BUL_bulgarian_will_desc:0 "The Slavic peoples are known for their physical and mental strength. If we are to be unbreakable in order to win, then we shall become so."

  BUL_dockyards_of_varna_desc:0 "We should put our effort on producing a concentrated dockyard area to produce ships at. The ideal place is Varna, one of our biggest cities."

  BUL_bulgarian_research_committee_desc:0 "In order to advance quicker, we are to focus our efforts on research."

  BUL_license_german_equipment_desc:0 "We need to upgrade our equipment, but until then we can ask other nations for their technology. Our best bet is Germany, by far, as they have the best technology around."
  BUL_license_soviet_equipment_desc:0 "One way to upgrade our army is to deploy Soviet equipment in our army. Soviet equipment is better than that of any of our potential enemies, and they might be willing to agree."
  BUL_allied_research_support_desc:0 "Joining with our allies, we are more likely to achieve things than we otherwise would. It would be a good idea to percieve this."

  BUL_bulgarian_resentment_desc:0 "The Bulgarians long resent their Balkan neighbours over their losses during the Balkan Wars. We should recognise this and use it in our advantage."
  BUL_reassert_western_claims_desc:0 "We've lost plenty of territory in the past thirty years, we should let the world know that we still desire these territories."
  BUL_german_arm_deliveries_desc:0 "We should try to undermine the treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the United Kingdom has said it'll allow us in the face of immediate external threats, and who better to ask than Germany?"
  BUL_deal_with_the_macedonian_problem_desc:0 "For too long have the Macedonians undermined our government. We should deal with IMRO as soon as possible - through whatever means."
  BUL_satisfy_the_macedonians_desc:0 "The most effective way to deal with the Macedonians is to appease them. Sacrifices will have to be made, but in the end it'll be worth it."
  BUL_honour_slavic_allegiance_desc:0 "Our true origins lay far away from here. We should show this to the Soviets, the leading Slavic country. Our loyalty should be only to them."
  BUL_join_the_comintern_desc:0 "In accomodation to the Soviets, we shall request to join the Comintern. This will naturally make them happy, and we will be protected, and our bond with our Slavic brothers will only be stronger."
  BUL_peasant_conviction_desc:0 "If our subjects believe in a successful Communist regime, then we will be just fine in our pursuit of true global collectivism."
  BUL_royal_communism_desc:0 "Our regime maintains Tsar Boris, but only as a figurehead. He will not have any real power, and the Communist Council will be assembled to lead the country."
  BUL_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "Keeping the Tsar would show weakness. We'll show our true strength by establishing the People's Republic."
  BUL_sign_the_tripartite_pact_desc:0 "Germany would rather that we sign the Tripartite Pact and formally align with them. This would definitely help us on the go, but it could prove fatal in the long run."
  BUL_permit_german_troops_desc:0 "In order to appease the Germans, we should permit the Germans access to our territory to station troops in, if need be."
  BUL_join_the_axis_desc:0 "We have appeased Germany enough, signing the Tripartite Pact and allowing them access were the two steps needed to join the Axis, and we shall request to."
  BUL_expel_soviet_diplomats_desc:0 "We should show our loyalty and dedication to aiding the German cause, by expelling the Soviet diplomats from our country. Striking against our own brethren will convince them of our loyalty."
  BUL_dedication_to_the_axis_desc:0 "Our dedication to the Axis proves fruitful, as our country seems to be more supporting of Fascism. Hristo Lukov would be a wise choice when we elect our leader."
  BUL_the_wrong_axis_desc:0 "It appears we have chosen to join the wrong alliance. The Axis Powers aren't strong enough to protect us, and we maintained the Soviet diplomats. Time to make use of them."
  BUL_negotiate_with_the_soviets_desc:0 "It is time we start negotiating with the Soviets about our possible entry into the Comintern. We should secure our own survival before that of the Germans, and the Soviets can help with that."

  BUL_befriend_greece_desc:0 "Our decades long rivalry with Greece should come to an end. It's all been fun and well, but now is the time to band together."
  BUL_befriend_romania_desc:0 "Our northern neighbour, Romania, doesn't like us a whole lot. It is time to change that, so that the Balkans will stand together and won't be picked off one by one."
  BUL_formalise_the_balkan_entente_desc:0 "Being a part of the Entente system is good, but we should consider reaffirming it, so we can stand up to those who seek to invade us."
  BUL_alliance_with_the_entente_desc:0 "Now that we have appeased Yugoslavia, Romania and Greece, we should consider joining the Balkan Entente. The Balkan Entente will keep us strong."
  BUL_albanian_inheritance_desc:0 "Not only is Albania Slavic, Albania used to be part of the great Bulgarian Empires. It is time we amend the situation and remind them that their independence depends on our mercy."
  BUL_local_armour_acquirements_desc:0 "Rather than relying on external sources for our armoured equipment, we should devise and produce our own. That way we'll always be secure."

  BUL_global_detection_desc:0 "The next step in modernisation is, is RADAR, large-scale broadcasting will push Bulgaria into the future, starting with the establishment of a large transmitter in Vakarel."
  BUL_institute_for_nuclear_research_desc:0 "If Bulgaria is to advance with time, then it is of the utmost importance that we start our own research on Nuclear power."
  BUL_jet_fighters_desc:0 "While our old fighters accomodate our military as it is. It won't stay that way, and how better than to advance with a jump?"
  BUL_derhavna_samoletna_fabrika_desc:0 "Derhavna Samoletna Fabrika is a Polish factory set-up in Bulgaria to produce several Polish fighters locally for the Bulgarian military."
