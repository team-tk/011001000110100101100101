 uk_cas:0 "Fleet Air Arm"   
 uk_cas_desc:0 "We are entering a new Naval age - the primacy of old Battleships & Dreadnoughts is falling, and the position of Carriers rises in the opposite direction. We should establish a new joint air-naval wing with the intention of fully staffing our carriers under the Coastal Command."

 uk_constitution_desc:0 "It is time! With the assent of our major Dominions, we are finally in a position to sign the Imperial Constitution.

 uk_mw_1:0 "Begin Motorization"   
 uk_mw_1_desc:0 "As the Experimental Mechanized Force clearly showed, mobility on the battlefield trumps sheer weight of fire, something our generals have until now tragically neglected.

 uk_mw_2:0 "The Universal Carrier"   
 uk_mw_2_desc:0 "Though already in widespread production, the Universal Carrier has yet to be fully embraced by our armed forces. The diminutive vehicle may lack the full protection of larger vehicles, but is an incredibly capable tractor, troop carrier, and scout vehicle. We must contact Vickers-Armstrongs for sufficent mass-orders to build up large stocks of the vehicle!"
 uk_empire_america:0 "Restore North American Territories"   
 uk_empire_america_desc:0 "We have a number of dormant claims in America; British Columbia, but also that to the entire Thirteen Colonies, which were ripped from us long ago by upstart settlers.

 uk_hobarts_funnies_desc:0 "With increasingly heavy chassis and powerful suspension systems at the disposal of our engineers, some attempts have been made to mate bridge laying equiptment, flamethrowers, and demolition mortors with infantry tanks' hulls.

 uk_mw_3:0 "Mechanise the Artillery"   
 uk_mw_3_desc:0 "The ability to rapidly displace bases of fire over broken ground and across great distances is decisive. Whilst we already have schemes to put artillery behind motorised traction, we could act even more boldly if the artillery were given it's own mechanised mounting."   
 uk_mw_4:0 "Universalise the Mechanised Force"
 uk_mw_4_desc:0 "No longer experimental, we have come a long way from Salsbury Plain. Our experience has shown the enormous power of mobile, responsive units, and now the time has come to formulate a new divisional structure to incorporate these changes."
 uk_gbp_4:0 "Infantry Tank Primacy"

 uk_iraq_focus:0 "Secure Iraq"
 uk_iraq_focus_desc:0 "We granted Iraq independence in 1932, but considering the current global situation, that might have been a mistake.

 uk_iran_focus:0 "Secure Iran"
 uk_iran_focus_desc:0 "Collectivist influence is suspected to be spreading among the Iranian leadership.  We cannot allow this to happen, lest it creates another liability for our war effort.

 colonial_gangs:0 "Armed Gangs"
 colonial_gangs_desc:0 "Formation of nationalistically-minded armed gangs, similar to the Brownshirts & Blackshirts of Germany and Italy to enforce our new popular movement among those who might collaborate or apologise for the European oppressors will help to further our cause and solidify control."

 colonial_democracy:0 "The Ballot Box"
 colonial_democracy_desc:0 "The Europeans have brought us many things, good and bad, but their parliamentary democracy is undoubtedly their finest creation. Yet their beliefs in liberty are a hypocrisy to those who they crush underfoot for their own gain, so it is time to use their own concepts against them."
 colonial_protests:0 "Satyagraha"
 colonial_protests_desc:0 "As we see from the National Congress in India, a path to freedom is best tread lightly and peacefully, not with terrorism or violence; as even the European's best attempts at obfuscation cannot deny the righteousness of a nation yearning to be free to their populace"
 colonial_nice_nationalism:0 "Civic Nationalism"
 colonial_nice_nationalism_desc:0 "We are a nation, an ancient and proud one, slowly freeing ourselves of foreign control and influence. Where the European taught us we are savage, backwards, uneducated, we shall show them we can stand shoulder-to-shoulder in all affairs with our former masters."
 colonial_communism:0 "The Bomb"
 colonial_communism_desc:0 "The changes the Europeans have brought to our country will never go away; industrialisation, modernisation, capitalism, all of these now mire our land forever.

 colonial_citizenship:0 "Universal Citizenship"

 colonial_divide:0 "Divide and Rule"
 colonial_divide_desc:0 "To maintain our power here, and continue the flow of raw goods and money for the Empire, we would do best to distract the local people so they cannot rise up against us.
