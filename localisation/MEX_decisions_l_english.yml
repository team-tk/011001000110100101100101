 # ECONOMIC STUFF
 
 MEX_PEMEX_Situation:0 "The PEMEX Embargo"
 MEX_PEMEX_Situation_desc:0 "Mexico did not just accept the consequences of the PEMEX Embargo. Mexico had implemented countermeasures to use the newly nationalized oil and to support their fledgling oil indistry."
 MEX_Stove:0 "The Stove Act"
 MEX_Stove_desc:0 "In what is arguably an environmentalist stance, Mexico pushed the replacement of wood stoves for stoves relying on oil derivatives such as kerosene. This slowed the deforestation of Mexico, and gave the Mexican oil industry a domestic market."
 MEX_Charity:0 "Nationalist Donations"
 MEX_Charity_desc:0 "When Mexico proclaimed the nationalization of PEMEX, ordinary Mexicans donated everything they had to pay for the costs associated with the nationalization.

 # vice laws
 
 MEX_Vice:0 "Lenocinio Laws"
 MEX_Vice_desc:0 "Prostitution was a hot topic during Cardenas's reign. A hold over from the Pastry Wars and Ferdinand Maximilian's Mexican Empire, it gained notoriety during Porfiro Diaz's regime. Mexico's women still remember the humiliation as Diaz's economy forced them into poverty and then prostition. Families were ripped apart as a result, and historians claim this was one of the main reasons women fought so hard in the revolution and in huge numbers, out of pure hatred for Diaz's role in shattering their lives. The laws were hotly debated among doctors, prostitutes, feminist groups, and religious groups. Outside of religious groups, there was intense division over which stance they should take on prostitution. Ultimately, it was repealed to dismantle Porfiro Diaz's legacy and preserve the Mexican Revolution."

 #calles law
 MEX_LAW:0 "Law for Tolerance of Sects"
 MEX_LAW_desc:0 "The Law for Tolerance of Sects, also known as the Calles law, was one of the most strict laws ever created on the separation of the church and state Article 130 of the Mexican constitution. The law has multiple demands: \n 1. Religious orders were banned from taking part in politics in any way or face steep penalties. \n 2. Banned foreigners from acting in a religious capacity. \n 3. banned priests of any kind from teaching in primary school. \n 4. Banned religion from being taught in school. \n 5. Church property within the federal District was confiscated.\n This law created the Cristero War, as the number of priests were restricted to the point 17 had no priest at all. Others had only a single priest to service an entire state. This caused unrest and inefficiency in the religious rural sections of Mexico. This was a hot topic until its repeal in 1938."
