 bulgarians.1.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis in an effort to help us in our goal of world domination."
 bulgarians.1.a:0 "Let them in."
 bulgarians.1.b:0 "We don't want them in!"
 bulgarians.2.t:0 "We are allowed in!"
 bulgarians.2.d:0 "Germany has allowed us to join the Axis Powers and with that, we formalised our alliance and signed the Tripartite Pact."
 bulgarians.2.a:0 "Hurray!"

 bulgarians.7.t:0 "The Drama Uprising"
 bulgarians.7.d:0 "As a response to our Bulgarisation process, the Greeks have risen up and rebelled against the country. Many valiant soldiers were lost in combat against them."
 bulgarians.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
 bulgarians.9.t:0 "Treaty with Bulgaria"
 bulgarians.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested that we support them in modernisation, and request that we aid them in researching planes for the Bulgarian airforce. This might drive them closer to us, and might be worth it in the long run."
 bulgarians.9.a:0 "What's the harm?"
 bulgarians.9.b:0 "What?! No!"
 bulgarians.10.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgarians.10.d:0 "The Italians agreed to help with our modernisation!"
 bulgarians.10.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.11.t:0 "They didn't agree!"
 bulgarians.11.d:0 "The Italians didn't agree to our research treaty! Eventually we shall teach them."
 bulgarians.11.a:0 "Bah, filth."
 bulgarians.12.t:0 "Bulgaria to join the Comintern?"
 bulgarians.12.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested to join the Comintern. They are a socialist state now and it might be beneficial to add them to our alliance."
 bulgarians.12.a:0 "Very well"
 bulgarians.12.b:0 "They are alone"
 bulgarians.13.t:0 "They accepted!"
 bulgarians.13.d:0 "We have been accepted into the Comintern. Together, the Soviet Brotherhood stands strong!"
 bulgarians.13.a:0 "Finally!"
 bulgarians.14.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgarians.14.d:0 "We have been declined membership to the Comintern. This only makes them a target of Greater Bulgaria."
 bulgarians.14.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 bulgarians.15.t:0 "The Balkan Federation"
 bulgarians.15.d:0 "Bulgaria has offered that we join a faction with them based on our shared ideologies. It might be good, as this would prove that the Balkans can actually be united."
 bulgarians.15.a:0 "Seems fair."
 bulgarians.15.b:0 "I think not."
 bulgarians.16.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgarians.16.d:0 "Yugoslavia has agreed to our concept of a united Balkans. A Communist community in the Balkans is a great idea anyway, and anyone who says otherwise is foolish."
 bulgarians.16.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgarians.17.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgarians.17.d:0 "The Yugoslavians declined our idea for a united Balkans! The fools! We should show them!"
 bulgarians.17.a:0 "The fools!"
 bulgarians.18.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Thrace!"
 bulgarians.18.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their old territory of Thrace. While they formerly owned it after the First Balkan War, Thrace is now obviously Greek! However, appeasement might be a good call."
 bulgarians.18.a:0 "Give it up."
 bulgarians.18.b:0 "Thrace is Greek!"
 bulgarians.19.t:0 "Greece Accepted!"
 bulgarians.19.d:0 "The Greeks have accepted our demands for Thrace. They must realise that they are an inferior power compared to us."
 bulgarians.19.a:0 "Good."
 bulgarians.20.t:0 "The Greeks Declined!"
 bulgarians.20.d:0 "The Greeks have declined our demands for territory! We should show them who has the real power here!"
 bulgarians.20.a:0 "Indeed we should."
 bulgarians.24.t:0 "Macedonian Uprising!"
 bulgarians.24.d:0 "The Macedonians have risen up against us! Our way of dealing with them was less effective than hoped, and now they have risen up against us. We dealt with them, but it costed us manpower that's not easily replaced. However, we made sure it would not happen again."
 bulgarians.24.a:0 "Fools!"
 bulgarians.25.t:0 "An agreement proposed!"
 bulgarians.25.d:0 "The Bulgarians have proposed an agreement. For the Bulgarians have a clean record of adhering to the effects of the peace treaty of the Great War. They may have redeemed themselves, and they might be a usefull ally."
 bulgarians.25.a:0 "Alright, fine."
 bulgarians.25.b:0 "What, no!"
 bulgarians.26.t:0 "Greece agreed!"
 bulgarians.26.d:0 "Good news! The Greeks have agreed to lift the restrictions placed upon our country. We can now finally start preparing our country for the upcoming conflict."
 bulgarians.26.a:0 "Victory!"
 bulgarians.27.t:0 "The Greeks disagreed!"
 bulgarians.27.d:0 "The obviously disillusioned government of Greece has disagreed to our rearmament! We must act on this! If we are to prepare our country, then we shall have to stop abiding by the peace treaty."
 bulgarians.27.a:0 "Then so we shall."
 bulgarians.28.t:0 "Bulgaria demands Dobrudja"
 bulgarians.28.d:0 "Bulgaria has demanded their former territory of Dobrudja. They formerly owned this territory after the First Balkan War, but gradually lost it when the Second Balkan War kicked off. It might be wise to appease them, although if we could destroy them before they become a threat, that would be good."
 bulgarians.28.a:0 "Give it back"
 bulgarians.28.b:0 "No, it's ours!"
 bulgarians.29.t:0 "Romania agrees!"
 bulgarians.29.d:0 "Romania has agreed to give us back Dobrudja, the territory we lost after the events of the Great War. We should use this opportunity."
 bulgarians.29.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarians.30.t:0 "Romania declined!"
 bulgarians.30.d:0 "The Romanians have declined our demand for Dobrudja! We should teach them not to oppose us!"
 bulgarians.30.a:0 "Damnation!"
 bulgarians.30.b:0 "Ask the Germans"
 bulgarians.30.c:0 "Never mind, give up"

 bulgarian_news.1.t:0 "The Bulgarians signed the Tripartite Pact!"
 bulgarian_news.1.d:0 "Today, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry announced that they had formally signed the Tripartite Pact with the German Reich, formalising their military and economic ties with them. The minister was cited as giving it as a result of growing tension in the region in order to defend Bulgarian sovereignty.  /n/nWhilst this might be the official statement, many in the international scene see this as a more aggressive move in line with more revanchist policies."
 bulgarian_news.1.a:0 "Well then"
 bulgarian_news.1.b:0 "Hay!"
 bulgarian_news.1.c:0 "A toast to the Bulgarians!"
 bulgarian_news.2.t:0 "Bulgaria joins the Comintern!"
 bulgarian_news.2.d:0 "Bulgaria has joined the Comintern and decided to reinforce their Slavic brothers in the potential conflicts to come."
 bulgarian_news.2.a:0 "Fair enough."
 bulgarian_news.2.b:0 "Woohoo!"
 bulgarian_news.2.c:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
 bulgarian_news.4.t:0 "Tsar Boris III dies!"
 bulgarian_news.4.d:0 "Tsar Boris the Third of Bulgaria has tragically died from heart failure today. Formally, Simeon II, Boris' son, would take over the tsardom, but being not of age, Boris' brother, Prince Kiril of Preslav, took over command of the country."
 bulgarian_news.4.a:0 "Oh well"
 bulgarian_news.5.t:0 "Tsar Boris survives alleged assassination"
 bulgarian_news.5.d:0 "According to the Bulgarian news papers, Tsar Boris had survived an attempt of assassination, allegedly planned by Germany to dispose of the tsar."
 bulgarian_news.5.a:0 "Allegedly? Hm.."
 bulgarian_news.6.t:0 "Restrictions upon Bulgaria lifted!"
 bulgarian_news.6.d:0 "The Greek government has agreed to the rearmament of the Bulgarian military. After the Great War, Bulgaria has been limited in its military efforts and production. Bulgaria has a record of abiding to them however, which convinced the Greeks that the effects should be lifted."
 bulgarian_news.6.a:0 "If they deem it wise.."
 bulgarian_news.6.b:0 "... Yeah, thanks.."

 bulgariansenhanced.1.t:0 "Bulgaria requests German arms!"
 bulgariansenhanced.1.d:0 "Bulgaria, in their effort to rearm themselves, has requested our support. The Bulgarians say that the British have allowed them to rearm freely, citing the instability in the region as their reasoning. Now the Bulgarians request that we send them a few thousand guns to help them in rearming. Agreeing would develop our relations with the Bulgarians but they could just as easily stab us in the back and side with the enemy, we should carefully consider our options."
 bulgariansenhanced.1.a:0 "Very well, help them."
 bulgariansenhanced.1.b:0 "They're on their own."
 bulgariansenhanced.2.t:0 "The Germans agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.2.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to our request for aid in rearming. We have been given two-thousand guns to help us along. Obviously, we should compensate them! Or we could use the guns and never look at them again, it's a lottery."
 bulgariansenhanced.2.a:0 ".. Yeah."
 bulgariansenhanced.3.t:0 "The Germans declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.3.d:0 "The Germans have declined our most generous request for supplies! We only requested two-thousand guns, and they can definitely spare the guns. Damn them!"
 bulgariansenhanced.3.a:0 "What! Filth!"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.t:0 "Bulgarian Friendship?"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.d:0 "Bulgaria has suggested that we sign a Treaty of friendship with them, to be labeled the Treaty of Eternal Friendship. The Bulgarians want to improve relations with us, now this is obviously a trap, but going along with it might actually be fruitful for us."
 bulgariansenhanced.4.a:0 "Sign it!"
 bulgariansenhanced.4.b:0 "How about.. no."
 bulgariansenhanced.5.t:0 "Yugoslavia agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.5.d:0 "The Yugoslavs agreed to our Treaty of Eternal Friendship! I figure they realise that we actually are their friends! Well, they think we are, but we know better."
 bulgariansenhanced.5.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.t:0 "Yugoslavia declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.d:0 "The Yugoslavs have declined our Treaty of Eternal Friendship! How could they?! Do they not realise that we've changed? The fools! We should teach them!"
 bulgariansenhanced.6.a:0 "How unfortunate."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.t:0 "Georgi Kyoseivanov resigns!"
 bulgariansenhanced.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister resigns! Prime minister Kyoseivanov, who has led the country since 1935, has officially resigned from service! Now we could install a successor, which would be Bogdan Filov, an ally of Tsar Boris himself! Or we could dissolve Kyoseivanov's government entirely and install Boris III as our leader, considering, he is. We'd be installing a government handpicked by Boris himself."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.a:0 "Filov it is."
 bulgariansenhanced.7.b:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
 bulgariansenhanced.8.t:0 "Fatherland Front empowered!"
 bulgariansenhanced.8.d:0 "Our attempt to empower the Fatherland Front has paid off! The Fatherland Front just became the majority party of the government and they've officially taken control. Tsar Boris is still in power but no longer in direct control. Now to hope that the Fatherland Front can steer us away from Germany's side and on the Soviet side."
 bulgariansenhanced.8.a:0 "Hay!"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.t:0 "Entry to the Balkan Pact?"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.d:0 "Bulgaria has requested entry to the Balkan Entente as an affiliate state. This means we'll guarantee them our aid if anyone goes to war with Bulgaria. Naturally, when someone does go to war with them, we can just abandon them, although this'll cost us our reputation. Of course we can also decide not to guarantee them and we'll be off fine."
 bulgariansenhanced.9.a:0 "Welcome them in!"
 bulgariansenhanced.9.b:0 "They're on their own."
 bulgariansenhanced.10.t:0 "They said no!"
 bulgariansenhanced.10.d:0 "Those bloody Romanians rejected our request! We're not allowed into the Balkan Entente! This is maddening! We should take revenge, and shoot them, or something. They can't be allowed to do this."
 bulgariansenhanced.10.a:0 "What!"
 bulgariansenhanced.11.t:0 "Bulgarians wish to negotiate!"
 bulgariansenhanced.11.d:0 "It seems the Bulgarian government has finally realised that they're on the losing side of this war, rather late, might I add. We will obviously be compensated for this. That aside, it's now time for us to decide their fate. Either they'll become our ally against the Germans and join the Comintern, or we'll leave them to be crushed by the Soviet might."
 bulgariansenhanced.11.a:0 "Yeah alright."
 bulgariansenhanced.11.b:0 "Kill!"
 bulgariansenhanced.12.t:0 "They agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.12.d:0 "The Soviet have agreed to let us into the Comintern! Now we'll be fighting on the good side, and we might gain something out of this too! But now, we should focus on the fighting with Nazi Germany, and make the Soviets proud."
 bulgariansenhanced.12.a:0 "Mila Rodino Bulgaria!"
 bulgariansenhanced.13.t:0 "The Soviets declined"
 bulgariansenhanced.13.d:0 "The Soviets have declined our offer! Our attempt at survival with the Soviets has failed. Now we should do all we can to survive on the side of the Germans. We should make them proud, but more importantly, make our country and our people proud."
 bulgariansenhanced.13.a:0 "Damnation!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.t:0 "Bulgaria wants to re-affirm the Balkan Entente!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.d:0 "The current system that is the Balkan Entente seems to have fallen out of practise. Our allies will not help us in a war unless we bind them by treaty. Maybe this is actually a good idea. On the other hand, if we want to step away from the Balkans, we should probably not re-affirm it."
 bulgariansenhanced.14.a:0 "Found it! Send out the invites!"
 bulgariansenhanced.14.b:0 "Nah."
 bulgariansenhanced.15.t:0 "The Romanians agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.15.d:0 "The Romanians have agreed to re-affirming the Balkan Entente. We've been invited as an honoured member, and should Romania prove incapable of leading the alliance any further, that role should fall to us. With that said, the other members of the Balkan Entente have also been invited to re-affirm the Balkan Entente. They probably realise that the current system is really broken anyway, so we'll be good."
 bulgariansenhanced.15.a:0 "Oh hey!"
 bulgariansenhanced.16.t:0 "The Romanians hate us!"
 bulgariansenhanced.16.d:0 "Okay maybe too dramatic, they probably don't hate us. However, they will not re-affirm the Balkan Entente. It is probably safe to assume that they're looking to lash out on their own. Or they do truly hate us and the other members of the Balkan Entente. One or the other. Either way, now there are two of them."
 bulgariansenhanced.16.a:0 "Two of them? What?"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.t:0 "The Albanian Inheritance"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.d:0 "The Bulgarians have demanded that we become their puppet, citing that our territory was supposedly the territory of one of their former empires. Naturally, we don't remember any of this. However, the Bulgarians outsize us by far, and there's only a slim chance that we'll be able to defeat them if they come invading us. It might be feasible to become their puppet and gain our independence back, although if you're faithful, by all means, go ahead and decline."
 bulgariansenhanced.17.a:0 "Yeah alright let's go"
 bulgariansenhanced.17.b:0 "I'm faithful!"
 bulgariansenhanced.18.t:0 "They agreed."
 bulgariansenhanced.18.d:0 "The Albanians realised that we're right, and they have accepted us as their legitimate overlords. Now, we should peacefully integrate Albania into Greater Bulgaria. They are just one step towards making our nation great again."
 bulgariansenhanced.18.a:0 "Bam."
 bulgariansenhanced.19.t:0 "They declined!"
 bulgariansenhanced.19.d:0 "The foolish Albanians have declined our request to become our puppet! Do they not realise that their territory is ours by right? What's wrong with them?! We should seize their territory with immediate effect! They disrespect the greater Bulgarian Empire!"
 bulgariansenhanced.19.a:0 "Attack!"
 bulgariansenhanced.20.t:0 "The Romanians agreed!"
 bulgariansenhanced.20.d:0 "The Romanians have agreed to our request of partnership with the Balkan Entente. If somebody goes to war with us now, the Romanians should come to our aid, hopefully. Now we should evolve this into a functional alliance, between us, Romania, and the other members of the Balkan Entente."
 bulgariansenhanced.20.a:0 "Woo!"
 bulgariansenhanced.21.t:0 "The Bulgarians Request We Act As Meditators for Southern Dobrudja"
 bulgariansenhanced.21.d:0 "Following a wave of nationalism and revanchism in Bulgaria over the land they lost in the Great War, the Bulgarian ambassador to Germany today requested that we conclude the future of the region. The Bulgarians claim that it was robbed off them in the Second Balkan War, and it has an ethnic majority of Bulgarians."
 bulgariansenhanced.21.a:0 "We understand what it is like to lose rightful land."
 bulgariansenhanced.21.b:0 "The Romanians will serve us as a better ally."
 bulgariansenhanced.22.t:0 "The Germans Demand We Cede South Dobrogea"
 bulgariansenhanced.22.d:0 "It would seem the Bulgarians, too cowardly to fight us on their own, have licked the boots of their former master in the Great War to attempt to seize Romanian lands. Whilst we might be able to fight the Bulgarians, the threat of German invasion remains a lingering factor."
 bulgariansenhanced.22.a:0 "Why die for Dobrogea?"
 bulgariansenhanced.22.b:0 "Rather we die than dishonour ourselves."
 bulgariansenhanced.23.t:0 "The Germans Refuse to Help"
 bulgariansenhanced.23.d:0 "Despite the fact that Germany too suffered injustices of land stolen in treaties enforced, they refuse to aid us in our rightful reacquisition of land, claiming they do not intend to upset the Balkan power balance."
 bulgariansenhanced.23.a:0 "Nonsense. If you want something done properly.."
 bulgariansenhanced.24.t:0 "Romania Cedes Dobrubja"
 bulgariansenhanced.24.d:0 "Jubliant scenes across Bulgaria and the reclaimed lands as the Romanians cede the territory they stole from us. We have agreed to exchange populations with them under German observation. This is the first step to returning to our rightful position."
 bulgariansenhanced.24.a:0 "One injustice removed, more to come."
 bulgariansenhanced.25.t:0 "The Romanians Refuse to Cede Southern Dobrudja."
 bulgariansenhanced.25.d:0 "Despite influence from the Germans and the rightful position the territory has in Bulgaria, the dastardly Romanians once again deny us and the Prussians from our right. Words have failed us, but we are not exhausted for options."
 bulgariansenhanced.25.a:0 "Let us put the Romanians in their place."
 bulgariansenhanced.26.t:0 "The Bulgarians Present a Partition of Yugoslavia"
 bulgariansenhanced.26.d:0 "Our Bulgarian friends in the Balkans present a solution to deal with the artificial state of Yugoslavia. A nation born out of cruel treaties, it seems only right to end it. They state that upon an invasion of Yugoslavia, they will move into Macedonia as they did in 1915, and the Slavs will be crushed in days."
 bulgariansenhanced.26.a:0 "Another humiliation of the Great War undone."
 bulgariansenhanced.26.b:0 "We share land with nobody!"
 bulgariansenhanced.27.t:0 "The Germans Accept the Partition"
 bulgariansenhanced.27.d:0 "The Germans see the sense in our plan, and agree to help eliminate the failed state of Yugoslavia and return what is rightfully ours."
 bulgariansenhanced.27.a:0 "A toast to our old German Allies!"
 bulgariansenhanced.28.t:0 "The Germans Refuse the Partition"
 bulgariansenhanced.28.d:0 "The Germans, as if their low character was the subject of Greek plays, have refused to aid us in our reclamation of what is Bulgarian land occupied by the Serbians. We stand alone as we did when we were betrayed by the Balkan League all those years ago."
 bulgariansenhanced.28.a:0 "Alone, but not weak."
 bulgariansenhanced.29.t:0 "Honour the Bulgarian Agreement?"
 bulgariansenhanced.29.d:0 "Yugoslavia is under our control, as is Macedonia. Should we honour our agreement to the Bulgarians and cede Macedonia to them, or keep it for ourselves?"
 bulgariansenhanced.29.a:0 "Yes, they will serve as a valuable ally."
 bulgariansenhanced.29.b:0 "No, we have other plans."
 bulgariansenhanced.30.t:0 "The Germans Return Macedonia"
 bulgariansenhanced.30.d:0 "Honouring our agreement, the Germans officially transferred control of parts of Macedonia to our control. The ceremony was conducted by Generalfeldmarschall Gunther von Kluge and Bulgarian Field Marshal Dimitr Ayryanov in Skojpe, signalling the return of Bulgarian lands in the region to the Treaty of San Stefano."
 bulgariansenhanced.30.a:0 "We wash away the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine."
 bulgariansenhanced.31.t:0 "The Germans Refuse to Honour the Agreement"
 bulgariansenhanced.31.d:0 "It appears the rumours of German misdeeds, told from Ireland to Cathay, are true. They have refused to give us the territory they agreed on, breaking our pact and revealing themselves as traitors. This cannot stand."
 bulgariansenhanced.31.a:0 "Perhaps we should consider better allies.."
 bulgariansenhanced.32.t:0 "The Bulgarians Propose a Deal"
 bulgariansenhanced.32.d:0 "The Bulgarian Ambassador presented the Italian government today with the proposition of splitting Greece between them. Our Mediterranean ambitions are apparent to the Bulgarians it would seem, who request we return Thrace to them for aid in our campaign to ensure the control of the Adriatic. How should we respond?"
 bulgariansenhanced.32.a:0 "We share similar goals, and how hard can it be to invade Greece?"
 bulgariansenhanced.32.b:0 "Bulgaria? You mean Provincia Thracia"
 bulgariansenhanced.33.t:0 "The Italians Agree To Our Proposal"
 bulgariansenhanced.33.d:0 "The Italians have agreed to return Thrace to us should they come into conflict with the Greeks, returning us to the Aegan sea."
 bulgariansenhanced.33.a:0 "I'm sure the Italians will have no problem with the Greeks."
 bulgariansenhanced.34.t:0 "The Italians Refuse Us"
 bulgariansenhanced.34.d:0 "The Italian government has turned us down, like they betrayed the Germans and Austrians in the Great War. They can be trusted with nothing it would seem, intending to take all of Greeec for themselves."
 bulgariansenhanced.34.a:0 "Then we shall work to undermine them."
 bulgariansenhanced.35.t:0 "Give Thrace to Bulgaria?"
 bulgariansenhanced.35.d:0 "Greece has been conquered, a stunning display by our capable and incredible army, and now the Bulgarians have requested permission to send their troops into Thrace to take it. Should we honour the pact?"
 bulgariansenhanced.35.a:0 "Yes,the Great War injustices must be removed."
 bulgariansenhanced.35.b:0 "I think we'll keep it."
 bulgariansenhanced.36.t:0 "The Italians Return Thrace"
 bulgariansenhanced.36.d:0 "Today, in a grand ceremony in Gyumyurdžina, formely Komotini, Italian forces lowered the Greek flag and Bulgarian soldiers raised our proud colours, bringing us back to the Aegan Sea and returning our stolen lands. The Tsar himself was present for the occasion, along with parts of the Royal Family."
 bulgariansenhanced.36.a:0 "It's good to be back."
 bulgariansenhanced.37.t:0 "The Italians Refuse to Return Thrace"
 bulgariansenhanced.37.d:0 "On the border with Italian occupied Greece, Bulgarian forces were stopped from crossing into Thrace today by Italians. Despite the lack of armed conflict between the two, tensions remain high as the Italians have refused to return Thrace to us. This great betrayal will not be taken lightly."
 bulgariansenhanced.37.a:0 "We will not bow to those who lost to Africans once."
