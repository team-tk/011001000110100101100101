 MEX_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mondragón M1908"
 MEX_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mondragón, created by Manuel Mondragón before his exile, was the first semi-automatic rifle adopted by any nation's military. Chambered in the German 7x57mm Mauser cartridge, it was one of the most influential guns from its period. However, it suffered from an overly complicated design and reliability issues when in contact with mud, as well as not performing well with ammunition of poor quality. Due to the Mexican revolution, these guns were manufactured in Switzerland."
 
 MEX_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Fusil Mexico"
 MEX_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Fusil Mexico was a pull-apart rifle with a sliding action instead of the traditional bolt action. Its intention was that having the spent cartridge ejected automatically instead of manual ejection, it would speed up the rate of fire. The rifle would break into separate pieces for easier cleaning, and better reliability at the cost of a more complex gun. The rifle however was rejected by the Mexican military in favor of building licensed Kar 98s."

 MEX_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Tractor Tank"
 MEX_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Tractor tanks are light tanks made from a tractor frame and engine, popular in the early 1930s due to the Great Depression hampering the ability to field tanks cheaply. One of the most famous examples of tractor tanks was the Disston tank, which was sold to countries who wanted tanks on a budget. A placeholder as Mexico never bought or designed a tank in 1934 and exists only for player convenience in the production tab for easy reading."

 MEX_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "Mexico had a very close relationship with the French, obvious from the huge amount of French equipment and uniforms being used by Mexico.

While Mexico never bought French tanks, this tank is the cheapest medium tank that fits in the years just before 1940. The other choice, the Somua 35, was incredibly expensive to make and suffered many design flaws that made it worthless."
