This, and the lack of rigidity of Neurath during the suppression of Czech resistance, resulted in his actual removal from office.\n \nAt the end of September 1941, Hitler summoned von Neurath and said that he had decided to appoint him Deputy Heydrich. Von Neurath disagreed with this decision and announced his resignation from this post. Then Hitler sent von Neurath on "indefinite vacation". His duties were transferred to Heydrich as "acting reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia" (ger. "Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor von Böhmen und Mähren").\n \nThus, Heydrich became the actual Reichsprotektor (von Neurath never returned to his duties), retaining the post of head of the Directorate of the RSHA. On September 27, 1941, Heydrich took up residence in Hradcany. His summer residence, which moved his family, Heydrich gave in to get him after the resignation of K. von Neurath, the so-called "Lower Palace" in the town Panenske-Brzezany 15 km to the North from Prague, confiscated from sharoprokatnogo Jewish origin of Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer."

In the supporters of Great Italy also considered Albania, Montenegro, Northern Tunisia. They also insisted on a closer incorporation of Northern Libya, conquered ("General terms") in 1911-1912. The project involved the creation of an Italian state in which non-Italian elements would be assimilated and Italian colonization encouraged.\n \nThe supposed expansion would help Italy regain the Mediterranean domination lost after the fall of the Roman Empire. In preparation for the war with France, in 1940, the fascist regime "took aim" at Corsica, nice, Savoy, Tunisia and Djibouti. On 10 June 1940, the foreign Minister, count Ciano, came up with the idea of dividing Switzerland between Germany and Italy: the cantons of Ticino, graubünden and Valais could move to the latter.

The Hanko Peninsula was leased to the USSR as a naval base.Occupation of Norway by Germany, which cut off Finland from direct ties with great Britain and France, led to the fact that since may 1940 Finland has committed to strengthening relations with Nazi Germany. At this time in Germany on the orders of Adolf Hitler began to develop a plan of attack on the Soviet Union, Finland acquired the interest for Germany as a base for the deployment of troops and a base for military operations, as well as a possible ally in the war against the Soviet Union. On August 19, 1940, the German government terminated the arms embargo on Finland in exchange for allowing the use of Finnish territory for the transit of German troops to Norway. Although Finland was still suspicious of Germany because of its policies during the Winter war, the Finns saw it as the only Savior.Finland expressed its readiness to join Germany in its war against the USSR under several conditions:\n \nGuarantee of independence of Finland;\n \nReturn the border with the USSR to pre-war (or better) condition;\n \nContinuation of the food supply;\n \n pFinland is not an aggressor, that is, enters the war only after being attacked by the Soviet Union.\n \n21—June 25 from the territory of Finland against the USSR acted naval and air forces of Germany. 22 Jun 1941 in response to the occupation of the Finnish troops of the demilitarized zone of åland of the Finnish troops was bombed by Soviet aviation.

This allowed the Republic of China to continue to occupy Inner Mongolia. In 1928, the Chinese government has divided Inner Mongolia between the provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar and Rehe In the 1930-ies the area was occupied by Japanese troops. However, The people of inner Mongolia continued to fight for freedom. In the period from the 20-30s of the XX century, some princes tried to rely on Japan to get rid of the Chinese occupation. Prince-Chingizid Demchugdongrub led the liberation struggle during this period. Now that we have full control of Inner Mongolia, we can integrate it under control Demchugdongrub, and therefore under our control"

SOV_seize_iran_desc:0 "Since the 30s, the Third Reich has been looking for possible allies in the Middle East. One such potential partner was Iran. Despite the strong position of British capital, which played a key role in the Iranian economy, the geopolitical bias towards the Third Reich became stronger. In addition, since 1933 Berlin has taken relations with Iran to a new qualitative level. Reich begins to take an active part in the development of the economy, infrastructure of Iran, the reform of the armed forces of the monarchy. In the Third Reich, Iranian youth, the military, whom Goebbels propaganda called "Sons of Zaratushtra", are being trained. German ideologists declared the Persians "Pure Aryans" and they were exempted from the Nuremberg Racial Laws by a special decree. As a result, by the beginning of the Second World War, the Third Reich had gained a strong position in Iran, and in fact the country was turning into a German base in the Middle East region. By 1941, the situation with Iran and its "Aryan bias" for Moscow and London was as follows: there was a real threat that Iran's oil and transport infrastructure built on British capital will be used by the Third Reich against the USSR and Britain. Thus, only one oil refinery in Abadan processed 8 million tons of oil in 1940. And aviation gasoline in the whole region was produced only in Baku and Abadan. In addition, if the German armed forces broke from North Africa to Palestine, Syria, or in 1942 reached the border of Baku – Derbent – Astrakhan, Turkey and Iran's entry into the war on the side of Germany would be a matter resolved. In connection with the planned offensive of the Wehrmacht deep into the Soviet Union, the Persian corridor, passing through the territory of the TRANS-Iranian railway, was one of the easiest ways to implement the lend-lease program implemented by the United States by sea. British and Soviet engineers recognized the great importance of this railway and sought to keep it under close attention. The increased number of attacks by German submarines and the ice covering of the sea in the area of Arkhangelsk have increased the danger of using this route, so that the need for the use of the railway has increased significantly. Moreover, the Soviet government sought to include Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmensahra ("Turkmen plain") part of the state, and to bring to power in Iran, the Communists. The pressure of the UK and the USSR on Iran led to an increase in tension and a massive anti-British speech in Tehran, which, according to the British, were of a Pro-German nature. Iran's strategic position hampered the security of the Soviet oil-producing areas and the rear of the red Army and threatened British military routes between India and the Mediterranean."
